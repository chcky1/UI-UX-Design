#ABOUT THE PROJECT : I have taken an existing website landing page and redesigned it using UI/UX. I used tools such as Figma, Dribbble, and Pinterest to get the resources and ideas. I have taken ChatGPT and redesigned it. More options, which are accessible if you go to the OpenAI website, are now available on the redesigned website landing page of ChatGPT. These enhancements are to improve user experience by making navigation more simple and providing clearer information about the features. The change helps make the experience more enjoyable and also encourages users to explore the full range of tools and functions that are accessible. The webpage is much brighter and livelier than before. The added colours and fonts have made the landing page more aesthetically pleasing. The whole redesign has been done using Figma. This approach allows for better flexibility in design and ensures that the visual elements are pleasing to the users. As a result, users are likely to feel more engaged and motivated to interact with the platform. There is a bar on the top from which the user has the option to explore and ChatGPT. The given accessibilities are exploring ChatGPT, team, enterprise, pricing, download and support. These are the availabilities in the header section. In the body we have a colourful background photo of ChatGPT along with the option to log in or download the app. In the footer section, there are a few things with which the user can know about ChatGPT in detail. These are the features that were available on the landing page of OpenAI, but now whatever is related to ChatGPT is available on the landing page of ChatGPT, which makes it more organised for the user. By making sure that every relevant detail is readily available in one location, this simplified method makes the user experience effortless.  Also, the design places a high value on clarity, enabling users to switch between features and learnÂ more about ChatGPT's capabilities effortlessly. This design is put together using ideas and multiple online reference videos and photos. I have acquired the skills to navigate and utilise tools such as Figma. I sought assistance from YouTube and resources provided by Codtech IT Solutions.
